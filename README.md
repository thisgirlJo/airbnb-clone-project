## üõ†Ô∏è Features Breakdown
1. **User Management**

Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Users can sign up, log in securely, update their details, and manage their roles (host or guest), forming the foundation of all platform interactions.

2. **Property Management**

Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings.
Each listing includes details such as title, description, location, price, and images‚Äîhelping guests browse and find suitable accommodations.

3. **Booking System**

Enables guests to book available properties for specific dates.
The system prevents overlapping bookings and ensures a smooth reservation process between guests and hosts.

4. **Review System**

Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings after completing a stay.
This feature promotes transparency, helps improve service quality, and builds trust within the platform community.

5. **Payment Integration**

Facilitates secure and reliable payment processing using trusted gateways like Stripe or Paystack.
Ensures guests can pay safely, and hosts receive timely payments for confirmed bookings.

6. **Search and Filtering**

Provides powerful search and filtering options by location, date, and price.
Enhances user experience by making it easy to find properties that match guests‚Äô preferences.

## üîí API Security

### Key Security Measures

**Authentication:**
Uses JWT or OAuth2 to verify user identity and prevent unauthorized access.

**Authorization:**
Role-based access control ensures users only perform allowed actions (e.g., hosts manage properties, guests make bookings).

**Data Encryption:**
All sensitive data (passwords, payments) is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (bcrypt).

**Rate Limiting:**
Controls request frequency to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.

**Input Validation:**
Sanitizes all user input to block SQL injection and XSS attacks.

**Secure Payments:**
Uses trusted gateways (e.g., Stripe, Paystack) for tokenized transactions‚Äîno card data stored on our servers.

**Why Security Matters**

Protects user data, ensures safe transactions, prevents system abuse, and builds trust within the platform.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** ensure that code changes are automatically tested, built, and deployed with minimal manual effort.
This process helps maintain code quality, catch bugs early, and speed up delivery to production.

**Why It‚Äôs Important**

- Ensures consistent and reliable updates to the application.

- Automates testing and deployment, reducing human error.

- Speeds up the development cycle and encourages collaboration among developers.

**Tools Used**

- GitHub Actions: Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows directly from the repository.

- Docker: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

- (Optional) Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI can also be used for advanced automation.
