1. **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
1. **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
2. **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
3. **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
4. **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
5. **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
6. **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
7. **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
8. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## 🔒 API Security
### Key Security Measures

**Authentication:**
Uses JWT or OAuth2 to verify user identity and prevent unauthorized access.

**Authorization:**
Role-based access control ensures users only perform allowed actions (e.g., hosts manage properties, guests make bookings).

**Data Encryption:**
All sensitive data (passwords, payments) is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (bcrypt).

**Rate Limiting:**
Controls request frequency to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.

**Input Validation:**
Sanitizes all user input to block SQL injection and XSS attacks.

**Secure Payments:**
Uses trusted gateways (e.g., Stripe, Paystack) for tokenized transactions—no card data stored on our servers.

**Why Security Matters**

Protects user data, ensures safe transactions, prevents system abuse, and builds trust within the platform.
